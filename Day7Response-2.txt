1.What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning? 
Tensors map out the relationship between vectors, other tensors, etc. This helps us create the nureal networks within the machine learnig process.

2.What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?

Tensorflow has had made a lot of updates so I feel like I am constantly searching up errors or watching videos on tensorflow. Although thanks to my mentor, I have been able to focus on one version of tensor flow(1.4.0) so it hasn't been bad. Reading the information from the tensorflow data is another experience if I am being honest. Although I have been able to read it better when I code it cause I can understand the various attibutes and the values associated with them.
