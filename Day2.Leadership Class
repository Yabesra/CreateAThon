My Refection on Dr. David Kong


A story has to hit three points: Choice, Challenge, OUtcome and some outlining moral lesson. To take a personal story and make it a collective story, this creating a relatiable story. Within a sorty is it important to be specific, vivid, and clear to the listener. This can be done by being vulnerable and sharing the emotions that motivated a certain action.

I really loved the quote form the lass from Maimondies-"Hope is a belief in the plausibility of possiable as opposed to the necessitu pf the probable."

As a Leader, to rally up the voices of the people we/they work with, it is up to us to guide the reader through the story in order to get them on our page. A good story teller can tap into their vulnerbility and emotions, becuase when we put down our barriers, others do the same for us")
